here is a collection of all the mobile apps i have coded using python and the kivy framework.
most of the files will have the buildozer.spec file already included although some may not have that file included.
if the buildozer.spec file is not included in the folder be sure to uncomment the p4a branch and switch it form master to develop to avoid errors when compiling the apk or aab files.
